 * Instead of using variable column names (e.g., date_name) throughout the analysis, transform the data set in input to use fixed column names
 * Instead of saving the entire input data set in the output, save only the columns used for analysis
 * Better progress reporting
   * Replace pbapply with something that can meaningfully report progress to shiny
   * Reporting of overall progress
   * Finer-grained progress updates from inside pblappy
 * Reproducibility: how does PRNG work across parallelization?
 * Testing: should do some
 * Roxygen
 * Parameterize on analysis variants to allow subsetting the variants by the user
 * User-configurable # of runs for MCMC
 * Why is the Travis build failing on R 3.4, and do we care? (Error: processing vignette 'brazil.Rmd' failed with diagnostics: argument is missing, with no default)
